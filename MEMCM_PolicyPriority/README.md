#### MEMCM Policy Priority

In this folder you'll find a couple quick functions to simplify setting the priority of a MEMCM Antimalware Policy, or Client Settings policy.

They could be improved by adding pipeline support from the builtin Get-CM* cmdlets for the respective types.... feel free to add a pull request :)
